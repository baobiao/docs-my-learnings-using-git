### Introduction
I wanted to document my personal learnings when transiting from centralized
version control systems anchored strongly on the concept of streams into
distributed version control systems like Git.  Specifically the use of GitHub or
a locally hosted Git repository.  I also wanted to pen down my personal thoughts
learnt from my professional role in helping my clients adopt DevOps with Git or
a type of Git as their source code management (SCM) system.  Of course no client
names are mentioned here.

I will also like to take this chance to practice the GitHub flavored markdown
syntax.  So here is my *story* about this journey to Git.
